My final project is a future development of the time-management tool, which I created for the p3. The time-management tool is based on the Eisenhower`s time-management method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). All events, which are entered by the user are stored in the local database and are mapped to the user. Moreover, there is a possibility to sync events with the google calendar.

Features:
	additional print pages;
	google calendar sync;
	User authentication;
	Account confirmation email`s;

JavaScript is used for frontend logic (event listeners, input verification, schedule creation and so on). Moreover JS Google API is used.

Please use your own testing google account to try the sync features.
