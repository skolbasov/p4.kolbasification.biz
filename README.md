1-2 paragraph description of your application

My final project is a future development of the time-management tool, which I created for the p3. The time-management tool is based on the Eisenhower`s time-management method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). All events, which are entered by the user are stored in the local database and are mapped to the user. Moreover, there is a possibility to sync events with the google calendar.

Features:
	additional print pages;
	google calendar sync;
	User authentication;
	user verification email`s;

What aspects of your application are being managed by JavaScript
JavaScript is used for frontend logic (event listeners, input verification, schedule creation and so on). Moreover JS Google API is used.

Please use your testing google account to try the sync.
